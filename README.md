BuyBest Application

Overview: BuyBest is a desktop application developed by a team of five students—Atakan Akar, Erdem Uğurlu, Asya Ünal, Seçkin Alp Kargı, and Barış Yaycı—to revolutionize the online shopping experience. This project aims to streamline the process of finding and purchasing products at optimal prices by offering features such as automated purchasing and seller analytics. The app allows users to set desired price points and automatically purchase products when prices meet their preferences, while sellers receive valuable market insights based on user interest.

Objectives:

Auto-Buy Function: Users can set desired price points for products they are interested in. The system tracks product prices and automatically triggers a purchase when the desired price is met. This function ensures users never miss a deal.
Seller Insights: Premium seller accounts receive detailed market analysis, providing insights into price trends and user preferences to optimize their pricing and sales strategies.
User-Friendly Automation: The app simplifies time-consuming price monitoring by automating the entire process and offering quick, hassle-free shopping.

Technologies:

Backend: The backend of BuyBest is powered by Django, a robust Python-based web framework. Django handles user management, including the authentication of buyers and sellers, while also managing transactions and the execution of the auto-buy functionality.
Frontend: The user interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and intuitive design for seamless interaction with the app's features.
Database: SQLite is used as the database management system. It stores user information, product details, price history, and transaction data. The database supports querying for price monitoring, auto-buy triggers, and analytics generation for premium sellers.
APIs: Web Scraping and APIs like Amazon Product Advertising API are used to gather real-time product prices from various e-commerce platforms. This allows users to track prices and ensure they are getting the best deals across platforms.
Features:

Auto-Buy System:

Users specify the price point at which they want to purchase a product.
The system tracks prices and, when the desired price is met, automatically completes the purchase using the user's preferred payment method (app wallet or credit card).
Users can enable automatic confirmation or receive notifications before purchase completion.

Seller Insights and Analytics:

Premium sellers can access data on user preferences and product price points, providing valuable insights into optimal pricing strategies.
Sellers receive notifications when demand peaks for certain price points, allowing them to adjust pricing dynamically.
Wallet and Payment Systems:

Users can load money into the app's wallet and make purchases directly. Wallet transactions are rewarded with bonuses such as coupons.
For users who prefer, credit cards can also be linked, allowing direct payment for purchases.
